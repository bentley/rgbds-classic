Note: despite the license text in the original source code, the author and copyright holder, Carsten SÃ¸rensen, has [authorized](https://github.com/rednex/rgbds/issues/128#issuecomment-360090230) relicensing under MIT:

> I'm fine with whatever you guys decide to do with RGBDS, as long as you decide on a license moving forward. Feel free to relicense my original code (if any is still left) under GPL, ISC, MIT, BSD, APL.
